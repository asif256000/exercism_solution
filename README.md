# Learning Rust

I was trying to learn Rust, and came to know about [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) and been loving it.

Now that I'm learning various other languages and sharpening my skills on others, I'm keeping track of them and posting the solutions I did here.

So this is officially my record of solutions in various tracks in Exercism. Good luck.

Primarily these commands might be required in regular usage of Exercism CLI:

- To configure exercism CLI with your token
  - exercism configure --token=<your-api-token>
- To download an exercise from exercism
  - exercism download --exercise=<exercise-slug> --track=<track-slug>
- To submit the solution once it is complete
  - exercism submit <implementation_file_paths>
- To see all commans supported by exercism CLI
  - exercism help
- You can open an issue in exercism/cli on Github with the output of the troubleshoot command
  - exercism troubleshoot
